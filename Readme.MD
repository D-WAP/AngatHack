Problem: Healthcare

Specific Problem: Physically Challenged Individual.

Solution: We Created A Chrome Extension Named EyeCan and A Website called Eyesite that will let physically challenged individual to navigate the computer with only using their eyes without the help of someone else. This will help them to feel they are still capable of doing things on their own. Some people who are physically challenge are getting low self esteem. With the help of EyeCan and EyeSite they can now feel that they can still do things on their own! They Can! We Can! EyeCan!

PS: Original System was made with a wheelchair. See video attached. It was our thesis. Hopefully someone may get an attention of our project.
